The purpose of this document is to, well, document my daily work, plans, etc.

Day One (Thursday, February 27th, 2025):
    Got a decent bit set up, got the github cloned into IntelliJ and was able to generate a UML doc
    using Claude AI. We'll probably be taking a couple of liberties to try and get this done properly,
    and that was probably one of them. We'll have to move quick if we are going to try and get this as
    close to finished as out two-man team. Got a bit behind waiting on Peter to get his head in the game
    but here we are.

Day Two (Friday, February 28th, 2025):
    I haven't had any contact with Peter, it doesn't look like he has committed and pushed anything since
    we got this set up yesterday. But we've had enough dilly-dally-ing and we need to get started on this.
    Following our UML that we generated yesterday, I plan to start coding on the Transaction (View,
    Controller, etc.) I'll probably make a branch for it so that Peter can see that that is my plan.
    We'll see how far I get.

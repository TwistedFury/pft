The purpose of this document is to, well, document my daily work, plans, etc.

Day One (Thursday, February 27th, 2025):
    Got a decent bit set up, got the github cloned into IntelliJ and was able to generate a UML doc
    using Claude AI. We'll probably be taking a couple of liberties to try and get this done properly,
    and that was probably one of them. We'll have to move quick if we are going to try and get this as
    close to finished as out two-man team. Got a bit behind waiting on Peter to get his head in the game
    but here we are.

Day Two (Friday, February 28th, 2025):
    I haven't had any contact with Peter, it doesn't look like he has committed and pushed anything since
    we got this set up yesterday. But we've had enough dilly-dally-ing and we need to get started on this.
    Following our UML that we generated yesterday, I plan to start coding on the Transaction (View,
    Controller, etc.) I'll probably make a branch for it so that Peter can see that that is my plan.
    We'll see how far I get.

    Well, it certainly ain't complete. But I have coded everything that the UML we made shows. I guess I'll
    take a break from here. I'll push this up to the transactions branch and we'll see what I can get done
    tomorrow. I can't expect too much but I'll try to get something done, preparing for white gloves on Sunday,
    so I'll probably have an hour or so.. progress is progress anyways.

Day Four (Sunday, March 2nd, 2025):
    Didn't really have the chance to work on anything yesterday, as by the time I was done cleaning, it was
    30 minutes till midnight. Got ready for whitegloves and they didn't even show up, how fun.

    I don't really know yet how everything is going to connect, but we will figure that out once we have the
    ruidmentary stuff coded in most of the different controllers and views. Today, I want to at least get started
    on the user and authentication system (LoginView, AuthController, User). We'll see how far I can get with that.

    Well, there wasn't really all that much to code. But it's there. I'm going to have to start mulling over how all
    of this is going to communicate with eachother, I'm thinking one 'overlord' controller that will have access to all
    other controllers but not anything else.
    That adds a bit of complexity to the whole thing, but should make all of the little bits of coding a little more
    worthwhile, I guess.
    Now to upload this part to the github as transactions and merge it to main.

Day Five (Monday, March 3rd, 2025):
    Don't really have very many plans, other than trying to see if I can implement the FileExample code into here. Other
    than that, I suppose I'll update my plans in this document.

    I'm starting work on a UserAuthV2 that, if it works, will work more smoothly and allow me to delete the original
    UserAuth system.

Day Six (Tuesday, March 4th, 2025):
    I've adapted it to work for our purposes, and have added a verification feature to have the writer check if those
    "credentials" exist prior to writing them to the file and I have switched the BufferedWriter to be in append mode,
    as that will allow us to add more credentials to the file by w/o the need for writing everything else to the file
    as well.

    Next comes implementing that into all of the other sides, which should be rather easy considering that it is set up
    such that all they need to do is 'extend' FileExample and to send the right inputs for it to work.
